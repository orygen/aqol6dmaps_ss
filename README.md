## aqol6dmap_ss: Create the Scientific Manuscript For An AQoL-6D Utility Mapping Study
This R Markdown subroutine program creates a scientific manuscript that summarises a utility mapping study. This subroutine is a study specific customisation of a utility mapping template manuscript authoring program available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5976987.

In order for this program to execute properly it must be supplied with a results summary object. If you have access to a previously generated study results summary object, then follow the steps in SetUp.R. Alternatively, you can rerun the study analysis and call this manuscript authoring sub-routine by running the complete study replication program available in the https://github.com/orygen/aqol6dmap_csp repository. A slightly more generalised version of that program is summarised in the CSP.pdf file available from: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DKDIB0
