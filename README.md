## AQoL-6D Utility Mapping Study - Manuscript Authoring Program
This program creates the manuscript and supporting information submitted to Current Psychology.

In order for this program to execute properly it must be supplied with a results summary object. The best way to do this is to call this program via the commands outlined in the Complete Study Program. The complete study program is available in the https://github.com/orygen/aqol6dmap_csp repository. A slightly more generalised version of that program is summarised in the CSP.pdf file available from: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/DKDIB0
