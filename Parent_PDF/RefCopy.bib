There are increasing concerns about the appropriateness of generic preference-based measures to capture health benefits in the area of mental health.
Objectives
The aim of this study is to estimate preference weights for a new measure, Recovering Quality of Life (ReQoL-10), to better capture the benefits of mental healthcare.
Methods
Psychometric analyses of a larger sample of mental health service users (n = 4266) using confirmatory factor analyses and item response theory were used to derive a health state classification system and inform the selection of health states for utility assessment. A valuation survey with members of the UK public representative in terms of age, sex, and region was conducted using face-to-face interviewer administered time-trade-off with props. A series of regression models were fitted to the data and the best performing model selected for the scoring algorithm.
Results
The ReQoL-Utility Index (UI) classification system comprises 6 mental health items and 1 physical health item. Sixty-four health states were valued by 305 participants. The preferred model was a random effects model, with significant and consistent coefficients and best model fit. Estimated utilities modeled for all health states ranged from −0.195 (state worse than dead) to 1 (best possible state).
Conclusions
The development of the ReQoL-UI is based on a novel application of item response theory methods for generating the classification system and selecting health states for valuation. Conventional time-trade-off was used to elicit utility values that are modeled to enable the generation of QALYs for use in cost-utility analysis of mental health interventions.}

abstract="Economic evaluation conducted in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)  provides information that decision makers find useful in many parts of the world.  Ideally, clinical studies designed to assess the effectiveness of health  technologies would include outcome measures that are directly linked to health  utility to calculate QALYs. Often this does not happen, and even when it does,  clinical studies may be insufficient for a cost-utility assessment. Mapping can  solve this problem. It uses an additional data set to estimate the relationship  between outcomes measured in clinical studies and health utility. This bridges the  evidence gap between available evidence on the effect of a health technology in one  metric and the requirement for decision makers to express it in a different one  (QALYs). In 2014, ISPOR established a Good Practices for Outcome Research Task Force  for mapping studies. This task force report provides recommendations to analysts  undertaking mapping studies, those that use the results in cost-utility analysis,  and those that need to critically review such studies. The recommendations cover all  areas of mapping practice: the selection of data sets for the mapping estimation,  model selection and performance assessment, reporting standards, and the use of  results including the appropriate reflection of variability and uncertainty. This  report is unique because it takes an international perspective, is comprehensive in  its coverage of the aspects of mapping practice, and reflects the current state of  the art.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Preference-weighted index scores of health-related quality of life are  commonly skewed to the left and bounded at one. Beta regression is used in various  disciplines to address the specific features of bounded outcome variables such as  heteroscedasticity, but has rarely been used in the context of health-related  quality of life measures. We aimed to examine if beta regression is appropriate for  analyzing the relationship between subject characteristics and SF-6D index scores.  METHODS: We used data from the population-based German KORA F4 study. Besides  classical beta regression, we also fitted extended beta regression models by  allowing a regression structure on the precision parameter. Regression coefficients  and predictive accuracy of the models were compared to those from a linear  regression model with model-based and robust standard errors. RESULTS: The beta  distribution fitted the empirical distribution of the SF-6D index better than the  normal distribution. Extended beta regression performed best in terms of predictive  accuracy but confidence intervals of the fit measures suggested that no model was  superior to the others. Age had a significant negative effect on the precision  parameter indicating higher variation of health utilities in older age groups. The  observations reporting perfect health had a high influence on model results.  CONCLUSIONS: Beta regression, especially with precision covariates is a possible  supplement to the methods currently used in the analysis of health utility data. In  particular, it accounted for the boundedness and heteroscedasticity of the SF-6D  index. A pitfall of the beta regression is that it does not work well in handling  one-valued observations.",
