abstract="BACKGROUND: Preference-weighted index scores of health-related quality of life are  commonly skewed to the left and bounded at one. Beta regression is used in various  disciplines to address the specific features of bounded outcome variables such as  heteroscedasticity, but has rarely been used in the context of health-related  quality of life measures. We aimed to examine if beta regression is appropriate for  analyzing the relationship between subject characteristics and SF-6D index scores.  METHODS: We used data from the population-based German KORA F4 study. Besides  classical beta regression, we also fitted extended beta regression models by  allowing a regression structure on the precision parameter. Regression coefficients  and predictive accuracy of the models were compared to those from a linear  regression model with model-based and robust standard errors. RESULTS: The beta  distribution fitted the empirical distribution of the SF-6D index better than the  normal distribution. Extended beta regression performed best in terms of predictive  accuracy but confidence intervals of the fit measures suggested that no model was  superior to the others. Age had a significant negative effect on the precision  parameter indicating higher variation of health utilities in older age groups. The  observations reporting perfect health had a high influence on model results.  CONCLUSIONS: Beta regression, especially with precision covariates is a possible  supplement to the methods currently used in the analysis of health utility data. In  particular, it accounted for the boundedness and heteroscedasticity of the SF-6D  index. A pitfall of the beta regression is that it does not work well in handling  one-valued observations.",
