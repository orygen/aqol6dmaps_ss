To efficiently allocate scarce public resources between competing mental health programs, it is useful to have a common measure of benefit. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) are generic indices of outcome that inform public health policy in many countries [@RN3417] and are frequently used in health economic evaluations, including in mental health. The “quality” in QALYs is often measured via the use of multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs), where domains of quality of life measured by a questionnaire are weighted using the preferences of people [@RN3418]. This approach produces a single health utility weight for each individual for each measured health state, anchored on a scale where 0 represents a state equivalent to death and 1 represents perfect health. Health utility weighs can be converted to QALYs by weighting the duration (the “years” part of QALYs) each individual spends in each health state.

MAUIs are regularly used in research studies such as clinical trials and epidemiological surveys, but rarely feature in routine data collection by mental health services. In the absence of direct measurement, mapping analysis has been developed to predict utility weights from standard health status measurements [@RN7; @Wailoo2017]. MAUIs such as the Assessment of Quality of Life – 8 dimensions (AQoL-8D [@Richardson2014]) have been shown to be sensitive to psychological distress and depression measures [@RN6] and can be mapped to [@RN4] using measures of psychological distress (measured using Kessler Psychological Distress Scale – 10 items, K10 [@RN16]) and depression and anxiety symptoms (measured using Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale – 21 items, DASS-21 [@henry_2005]). However, it is unclear which mental health measures are the most predictive of health utility and existing algorithms developed for adult [@RN4] or child [@pmid23943259] general populations are of questionable appropriateness for predicting health utility in clinical youth mental health samples. 

Currently available mapping algorithms are largely derived from cross-sectional data and assume that the associations between psychological measurements and health utility are time-invariant. Therefore the between-person association (variations in mental health symptoms associated with variations in health utility observed cross-sectionally in a population) can be applied to estimate the within-person association (changes in mental health symptoms associated with changes in health utility over time). However, this time invariant assumption may not be true (for example, health utility measures may be less sensitive to change compared with measures of mental health symptoms).
