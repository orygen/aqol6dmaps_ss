##	Ethics approval
The study was approved by the University of Melbourne’s Human Research Ethics Committee and the local Human Ethics and Advisory Group (1645367.1)

## Sample and setting
This study forms part of a youth outcomes measurement research program, and the study sample has previously been described [@Filia_2021]. Briefly, young people aged 12 to 25 years who presented for a first appointment for mental health or substance use related issues were recruited from three metropolitan and two regional Australian youth-focused primary mental health clinics (headspace centres) and assessed between September 2016 to April 2018. Sample characteristics are similar to previous descriptions of headspace clients, with slight differences in age (less aged 12-14, more aged 18-20), cultural background (more Culturally and Linguistically Diverse and less Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people), sexuality (fewer heterosexual clients) and housing (more in unstable accommodation) [@Filia_2021]. 

## Measures
We collected data on health utility, six candidate predictors of health utility including psychological distress, depression and anxiety measures as well as demographic, clinical and functional population information.

### Health utility
We assessed health utility using the adolescent version of the Assessment of Quality of Life – Six Dimension scale (AQoL-6D; [@RN10]) MAUI. It was selected due to its validity for use in adolescents, the relevance of its domains for a clinical mental health sample and its acceptable participant time-burden. AQoL-6D includes 20 of the 35 items from six of the eight dimensions of AQoL-8D, which has been identified as the most sensitive to symptoms of depression of five assessed MAUIs [@RN6]. AQoL-6D includes identical coping, independent living, pain and senses dimensions to AQoL-8D as well as briefer versions of AQoL-6D’s relationships and mental health dimensions [@maxwell2016deriving].  The coping dimension was the most responsive to depression symptoms of forty three dimensions from nine assessed instruments (five MAUIs, three subjective-wellbeing instruments and a capability-wellbeing instrument) [@RN6]. In addition to its relative brevity we chose AQoL-6D over AQoL-8D as it has an adolescent specific version and scoring algorithm [@moodie2010predicting] (available at https://www.aqol.com.au/index.php/aqolinstruments?id=92). The distribution of AQoL-6D instrument item specific scores within our sample has been described in a previous study [@cotton_hamilton_filia_2022].

### Candidate predictors
Data from six measures of psychological distress (one measure), depression (two measures) and anxiety (three measures) symptoms were used as candidate predictors to construct mapping models. These measures are widely used in clinical mental health services or clinically relevant to the profiles of young people seeking mental health care. The primary purpose for collecting these data was to inform the development of new outcome measures in youth mental health [@Filia_2021]. We have previously described the process we used to select these measures, which involved first identifying outcome domains of importance to clients of youth mental health services and then assessing and selecting a set of instruments that can validly measure these domains in youth samples [@Filia_2021].

The Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6; [@RN16]) was used to measure psychological distress over the last 30 days. It includes six items (nervousness, hopelessness, restlessness, sadness, effort, and worthlessness) of the 10 item version of this measure, K10. We used the US scoring system, in which each item uses a scale that spans from 0 (“none of the time”) to 4 (“all of the time”).

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; [@RN11]) and Behavioural Activation for Depression Scale (BADS; [@RN12]) were used to measure degree of depressive symptomatology. PHQ-9 includes nine questions measuring the frequency of depressive thoughts (including self-harm/suicidal thoughts) as well as associated somatic symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, fatigue, anhedonia, appetite, psychomotor changes) in the past two weeks. PHQ-9 uses a four-point frequency scale ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) to 3 (“Nearly every day”). For the PHQ-9 a total score is derived (0-27) with higher scores depicting greater symptom severity. BADS measures a range of behaviours (activation, avoidance/rumination, work/school impairment as well as social impairment) reflecting severity of depression. BADS includes 25 questions on behaviours over the past week, scored on a seven-point scale ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) to 6 (“Completely”). A total score is derived for the BADS (0-150) as well as subscale scores, with higher scores indicating greater activation.

The Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7; [@RN13]), Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED; [@RN14]) and Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS; [@RN15]) were used to measure anxiety symptoms. GAD-7 measures symptoms such as nervousness, worrying and restlessness, over the past two weeks using seven questions, with a four-point frequency scale ranging from 0 (“Not at all”) to 3 (Nearly every day”). A total score is calculated with scores ranging from 0 to 21 and higher scores indicating more severe symptomatology. SCARED is an anxiety screening tool designed for children and adolescents which can be mapped directly on specific Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) anxiety disorders including generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder and social phobia. It includes 41 questions on a three-point scale of 0 (“Not true or hardly ever true”), 1 (“Somewhat True or Sometimes True”) and 2 (“Very true or often true”) to measure symptoms over the last three months. A total score is derived with scores ranging from 0-82, with higher scores indicative of the presence of an anxiety disorder. The OASIS was developed as a brief questionnaire to measure severity of anxiety and impairment in clinical populations. The OASIS includes five questions about frequency and intensity of anxiety as well as related impairments such as avoidance, restricted activities and problems with social functioning over the past week. Total scores range from 0-20 with higher scores depicting more severe symptomatology.

### Population characteristics
We collected self-reported demographic measures (age, gender, sex at birth, education and employment status, languages spoken at home and country of birth). We also collected clinician or research interviewer assessed measures of mental health including primary mental health diagnosis, clinical stage [@McGorry_2006] and functioning (measured by the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS) [@Goldman_1992]).

## Procedures
Eligible participants were recruited by trained research assistants and responded to the questionnaire via a tablet device. Participants’ clinical characteristics were obtained from clinical records and research interview. At three-months post-baseline, participants were contacted in person or by telephone, to complete a follow-up assessment. Australian youth mental health services often undertake clinical management reviews at 90 days. This timing aligns with the period from treatment commencement in which the largest changes in clinical measures are most likely to be observed in a clinical youth mental health sample [@brown2022clinical]. 

## Statistical analysis
We undertook a three-step process to: i) gain insight into our dataset and measures; ii) specify models and assess model performance using cross-sectional data; and iii) specify longitudinal models and assess whether modelling assumptions were met.

### Pre-modelling steps
Basic descriptive statistics characterised the cohort in terms of baseline demographics and clinical variables. Pearson’s Product Moment Correlations (*r*) were used to determine the relationships between candidate predictors and AQoL-6D utility score.

### Cross-sectional model specification and assessment 
Good practice guidance on mapping studies [@Wailoo2017] does not advocate specific model types as the appropriate choice will vary depending on factors that include the health utility measure being mapped to, the applicable health condition and target population, the clinical variables used as predictors and the intended use of the mapping algorithm. Compared to the EQ-5D utility measures most commonly used in the mapping literature [@Mukuria2019], AQOL-6D has better dimensional overlap with mental health measures [@RN6] and is derived from a greater number of questionnaire items (which can generate more continuous utility score distributions). The types of models we explored reflected these considerations. 

We used a cross-section of our dataset (baseline measures only) to explore appropriate type(s) of models to use, compare the relative predictive performance of candidate predictors, and identify other potential risk factors associated with quality of life independent of mental health measures. 

As adolescent AQoL-6D utility score is normally left skewed and constrained between 0 and 1, ordinary least squares (OLS) models with different types of outcome transformations (such as log and logit) have been previously used in mapping [@RN7]. Similarly, generalised linear models (GLMs) address this issue via modelling the distribution of the outcome variable and applying a link function between the outcome and linear combination of predictors [@Dobson_2018]. Beta regressions, which can be considered a special form of GLMs, are another popular strategy for modelling health utility [@Hunger2011]. 

We chose to explore OLS, GLM and beta models with commonly adopted transformation algorithms. The models we selected for comparison were OLS regression with log, logit, log-log ($f(y) = -log(-log(y))$) and clog-log ($f(y) = log(-log(1-y))$) transformation; GLM using Gaussian distribution with log link; and beta regression with logit and clog-log link. For each candidate model type, we evaluated the modelling performance and predictive ability of a univariate model using the candidate predictor with the highest Pearson correlation coefficient with utility scores. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to compare model fitting using training datasets and predictive ability using testing datasets using three indicators including R^2^, root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) [@RN20; @RN19]. After identifying the best performing model type, we used 10-fold cross-validation to compare predictive ability of six mental health measures in predicting AQol-6D (one model for each candidate predictor). 

To evaluate whether candidate predictors could independently predict utility scores, we added a range of independent variables to each of the six models that included participants’ age, sex at birth, clinical stage, cultural and linguistic diversity, education and employment status, primary mental health diagnosis (anxiety only, depression only, anxiety and depression and other), region of residence (whether metropolitan - based on location of attending service) and sexual orientation. Functioning (as measured by SOFAS) was also included in each model to evaluate whether it can jointly predict utility with clinical symptom measurements.

### Longitudinal modelling and assumption testing
After identifying the best mapping regression model(s) for predicting between person change, we established longitudinal models to predict within person change. This was achieved using generalised linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) including both the baseline and follow-up data. All records with complete baseline data (with or without follow-up data) were included. 

Frequentist and Bayesian mixed effects models both use a sampling framework and are expected to produce similar results [@flores2022before]. However, we chose to use Bayesian linear mixed models as mixed effects models estimated with frequentist tools may not converge properly  [@bolker2009generalized]. Linear mixed effect models (LMMs) can be fitted in the same framework with Gaussian distribution and identify link function. Clustering at individual level is controlled via including random intercepts. Model fitting was evaluated using Bayesian R^2^ [@RN21].

We compared the model coefficients for each predictor’s score at baseline and score change from baseline to assess the potential bias of estimating score changes within individuals using score difference between individuals.

## Replicability and reuse
We undertook all our analyses using  ***R*** 4.0.5 [@RCitation], using a wide range of packages (see Online Supplement, Table A.5). To aid study replication and appropriate out of sample re-use of our mapping models, we developed novel software that we have previously described [@hamilton2024prototype] and distributed study code, data and documentation in online repositories (see Availability of data and materials).
