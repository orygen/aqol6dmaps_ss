## Cross-sectional models
<!-- Table start -->The 10-fold cross-validated model fitting indices from mapping models using `r get_ordered_sngl_csnl_mdls(results_ls, select_int = 1)` are reported in Online Supplement `r ifelse(params_ls$output_type_1L_chr=="Word","","Table")` A.1. There were convergence issues with beta regression models and, as they do not show major advantages in predictive performance, these models were not considered further.   

Model diagnoses (such as heteroscedasticity, residual normality) suggested better model fit of the clog-log transformed OLS model, as the distribution of clog-log transformed utility are closest to normal distribution among all transformation methods. Another benefit of the clog-log transformed model is that the predicted utility score will be constrained with an upper bound of 1, thus preventing out of range prediction. Therefore, OLS with clog-log transformation was chosen as the best model for further evaluation. The GLM with Gaussian distribution and log link is commonly used in mapping studies [@Mukuria2019], so was included to provide comparisons with other published work. 

PHQ9 had the highest predictive ability followed by OASIS, BADS, GAD7 and K6 (Online Supplement `r paste0(ifelse(params_ls$output_type_1L_chr=="Word","","Table "), "A.2")`). SCARED had the least predictive capability. The confounding effect of other participant characteristics were also evaluated, with SOFAS found to independently predict utility scores in models for all six candidate predictors (*p<0.005*). Sex at birth was found to be a confounder for the K6 model (*p<0.01*). A few other confounders, including primary diagnosis, clinical staging and age were identified as weakly associated with utility in mapping models using anxiety and depression measurements other than PHQ-9. Many of these factors are unlikely to change over three months, so were not evaluated in the mixed effect models.
