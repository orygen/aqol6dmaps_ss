Utility mapping models, instructions on how to apply them and study replication code are distributed as part of the study data repository (\url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/privateurl.xhtml?token=a437cc9c-b809-4513-bbef-a2333c1c934a}). R packages are available for replicating and transferring study methods (\url{https://ready4-dev.github.io/TTU/}) and applying the mapping models to out of sample data (\url{https://ready4-dev.github.io/youthu/}).
