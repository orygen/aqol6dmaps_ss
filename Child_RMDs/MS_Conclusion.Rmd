We have found that it is possible to predict both within-person and between-person differences in adolescent AQOL-6D utility weights from measures routinely collected in youth mental health services. Mapping algorithms developed from cross-sectional data can approximate longitudinal changes in health utility, but may slightly over-estimate these changes. The mapping algorithms we have developed can enable greater use of CUAs in economic evaluations using youth mental health data collections.
