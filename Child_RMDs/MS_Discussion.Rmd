Although there is encouraging evidence about the quality, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of youth mental health service innovations worldwide [@RN1027; @RN1033], the public health and economic returns from systemic reforms to support better mental health in young people needs to be better understood [@RN1043]. Our study contributes to this goal by developing tools that can facilitate derivation of QALYs from measures commonly collected in youth mental health services.

Our study is the first to evaluate longitudinal mapping ability between a wide range of affective symptom measurements and health utility in a cohort of help seeking young people. We were able to independently predict adolescent AQoL-6D from each of the six candidate measures we assessed, with PHQ-9 having the best predictive performance. Predictive performance was improved when adding a measure of functioning (SOFAS) as an additional predictor or confound to each model; SOFAS also performed well as an independent predictor. As many youth mental health services routinely collect data on at least one of the predictors included in our models, these mapping  models may have widespread applicability. 

Study results may be useful for helping service system planners to prioritise the measures to include in routine data collection. Although direct measurement of health utility with measures such as the ReQoL [@KEETHARUTH2021281] may be feasible in some mental health services, relying on clinical measures that can also map to health utility may be an attractive alternative.

Our study extends recent work that showed both PHQ-9 and GAD-7 can be mapped to EQ-5D and ReQoL MAUIs [@franklin2023enabling] using data from a UK adult clinical mental health sample.  Compared to that study, our mapping models have been derived from a clinical youth mental health sample, map to a different MAUI (adolescent AQoL-6D) and allow use of four additional clinical and one additional functional measures as predictors. Notably, although our sample had similar mean baseline PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores (indicative of moderate severity) to that of the recent study, mean baseline health utility was lower (0.589 compared to 0.653 â€“ 0.778), suggesting that the choice of instrument to map to has the potential to significantly influence the results of economic evaluations. Unlike the prior study, we did not use mixture models, but as health utility in our sample was more normally distributed, this is unlikely to be a limitation. Our modelling diagnostics suggest high performance.

A key feature of QALYs is their longitudinal dimension - health utilities are weighted and aggregated based on the time spent in varying health states. Our results suggest that cross-sectional variations in psychological distress, depression and anxiety measurements can be used to approximate the longitudinal change in health utility in this cohort. However, for psychological distress and depression measures at least, mapping algorithms developed from cross-sectional data may slightly over-estimate these changes, introducing bias into QALY predictions (overestimating QALYs for populations whose health utility improves over time, underestimating QALYs for those with deteriorating mental health). 

Key strengths of our study include the novelty of our clinical youth mental health study sample, the use of clinically relevant and frequently collected outcome measures as predictors, the appropriateness and range of statistical methods deployed, the comparison of within-person and between-person differences in health utility weight predictions and highly replicable, publicly disseminated study algorithms. We acknowledge limitations that our data pertained to a single country, and we explored only one MAUI-derived utility weight. However, using utility weight input data derived from the same country as that to which an analysis pertains may be relatively unimportant [@homecountryhypo], particularly when the MAUI is well suited to the relevant health condition (as is the case with AQoL and mental health [@RN6]). We did not examine some potential predictors that may be more common in some mental health services (for example we explored K6, as opposed to the expanded, and commonly used measure, the K10). We also did not develop age-group specific models which would be a potentially useful extension of this work.
